# Project Random Auth

Weekly project for Technigo's bootcamp, week 20: build a fullstack website including API and authentication frontend

This week's project was to build an API with authentication to implement a registration flow, and a frontend with register/login form and a page with some content visible only for an authenticated user.

## The problem

Project was quite simple. I used crypto and bcrypt for encryption of passwords. I used MateriaUI for styling, and I will try to become more comfortable in another project with this component library because it seems very interesting. I had some issues with the format of my response, but with a little help and some googling, I solved them.
